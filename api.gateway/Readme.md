# API Gateway Service

The API Gateway Service is a central component that provides a unified entry point for all the microservices in our system. It acts as a reverse proxy to handle incoming requests, providing various functionalities like routing, filtering, load balancing, and more.

## Introduction

The API Gateway is an essential part of our distributed system architecture. It simplifies client-side interactions with our services by offering a single, unified entry point. It provides a layer of abstraction, enabling us to add new features, manage traffic, and improve overall security.

## Features

- **Routing**: Direct incoming requests to the appropriate microservice based on the requested endpoint.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of microservices to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure access to the APIs using authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Caching**: Cache responses to reduce response times and minimize redundant requests to backend services.
- **Request and Response Transformation**: Modify request and response data to match the requirements of downstream services.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Collect and analyze logs and metrics to monitor the health and performance of the API Gateway.
- **Rate Limiting**: Control the rate of incoming requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of resources.

## Requirements

- Java 20
- Spring Boot 3
- Maven

## Getting Started

To get started with the API Gateway Service, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://git.dotnet.itechcraft.com/RnD/project-template-java.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd api.gateway`
3. Build the project: `mvn clean install`
4. Run the API Gateway Service: `mvn spring-boot:run`

Or you can use Dockerfile from this folder to build it in container.

The service will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Configuration

You can configure the API Gateway Service by modifying the `application.properties` file or by providing environment-specific configuration files. Customize the configuration to suit your specific deployment needs.

## Swagger Documentation

The API Gateway Service provides Swagger documentation, which allows you to explore and test the available endpoints. Access the Swagger UI at: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/`.

## Architecture

The API Gateway follows a microservices-oriented architecture, where it acts as the central entry point for all microservices. It leverages Spring Boot's powerful features to handle routing, filtering, and load balancing.
